### Google Public Data

Here is my opinion on one of the datasets found linked from [Awesome-DataScience](https://GitHub.com/bulutyazilim/awesome-datascience)

This is a dataset from Awesome-DataScience github page. You can find the datasets [here](https://www.google.com/publicdata/directory#!start=0). It is the list of all datasets available to public from google. There are a host of data providers here. 
The count of it is 135 at the time of writing this piece. The datasets range from world development indicators to all the outbreaks of diseases and much more.
Among this let's consider a dataset from world trade organization. It let's us monitor how different countries have developed and performed over the years with respect to the world
using U.S. census. We can compare how the merchandise trade and commercial services trade has evolved in between countries from 2005 to 2019. This will inform us or the country's governments to
observer which country is growing in which areas and to tighten the ties ane trade in those areas to reduce the supply chain gaps. Also, improve the areas where the dependency is growing so that
they can work towards being self-reliant to survive in the time of crisis.

### Book: An Introduction to R

This is to inform you about ["An Introduction to R - W. N. Venables, D. M. Smith, and the R Core Team"](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf).

This is a book for beginners to learn R just like myself who started learning R and has taken up few classes this fall in my masters program to build my skill in R.
As this book is from the R Core team, I feel it provides a better approach and insight than anything else. As this is provided for free, it is available to all who
are interested in learning R from the very basics written by the R team themselves as a sort of documentation.
