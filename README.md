### Google Public Data

Here is my opinion on one of the datasets found linked from [Awesome-DataScience](https://GitHub.com/bulutyazilim/awesome-datascience)

This is a dataset from the Awesome-DataScience GitHub page. You can find the datasets [here](https://www.google.com/publicdata/directory#!start=0). It is the list of all datasets available to the public from google. There are a host of data providers here. The count of it is 135 at the time of writing this piece. The datasets range from world development indicators to all the outbreaks of diseases and much more. Among this, let's consider a dataset from the world trade organization. It allows us to monitor how different countries have developed and performed over the years with respect to the world using the U.S. census. We can compare how the merchandise and commercial services trade has evolved between countries from 2005 to 2019. This will inform us or the country's governments to observe which country is growing in which areas and to tighten the ties and trade in those areas to reduce the supply chain gaps. Also, improve the areas where the dependency is growing so that they can work towards being self-reliant to survive in times of crisis.

### Book: An Introduction to R

This is to inform you about ["An Introduction to R - W. N. Venables, D. M. Smith, and the R Core Team."](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf)

This is a book for beginners to learn R, just like myself, who started learning R and has taken up a few classes this fall in my masterâ€™s program to build my skill in R. As this book is from the R Core team, I feel it provides a better approach and insight than anything else. As this is free, it is available to all interested in learning R from the very basics written by the R team themselves as a sort of documentation.
